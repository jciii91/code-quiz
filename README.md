# JavaScript Code Quiz

### This webapp is a timed quiz, with questions centered around JavaScript. 

### Users are served questions in a random order and have 75 seconds to answer as many as possible. Each question answered correctly adds to their score, while answering incorrectly takes away from their remaining time.

### At the conclusion of each quiz, players are given a chance to save their score. This app records up to the 10 highest scores submitted. Players can also choose to clear any previously recorded scores. High Scores can also be viewed at any time by clicking View High Scores.
